# KeyboardTest
 UWP Keyboard test to demonstrate input lag

I simulate it by remote debugging to a tablet device (running on an intel Atom x5-Z8350 cpu). 
With teamviewer I connect to the tablet and then I very rapidly enter text in the first textbox. 
For example I type ANM but only AN shows. When i press M again then the box shows ANMM.
You have try a few times few times to be able to reproduce it since it does not always happen.
And rapid typing is important
